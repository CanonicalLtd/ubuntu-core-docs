# Supported platforms

Ubuntu Core runs on a large range of hardware, and pre-built images are available
for specific reference platforms. These images are a great way to quickly get
started with Ubuntu Core on a Raspberry Pi, for example, or to explore Ubuntu
Core's features and evaluate its potential.

Canonical produces official images for the following platforms:

| Platform              | Hardware/CPU | Cores | Memory    | Storage   |

Ubuntu community members also work with, and produce, images for other
platforms and CPUs. Refer to these individual projects for more information on
what other unofficial images might work for your use cases.
