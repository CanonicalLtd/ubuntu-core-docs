# Ubuntu Core documentation

Ubuntu Core is Ubuntu engineered for IoT and embedded systems.

It's optimised for security and for reliable updates while remaining easy to
deploy, tamper-resistant, and hardened against corruption.

From a single Raspberry Pi used for media streaming, to a deployment of tens of
thousands for home automation, Ubuntu Core is the ideal platform for anything
that needs to run securely, be ever-ready, autonomously updated, and
tamper-proof.
